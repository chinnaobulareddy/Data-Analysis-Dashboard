# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive project in Tableau, designing multiple charts and graphs to analyze the dataset. The process encompassed several stages, including data processing, data cleaning, and data visualization, to derive meaningful insights and present them effectively.

# Plastic Pollution in Oceans-data-analysis(Interactive Dashboard Creation By Using Tableau)

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze the growing problem of plastic waste in our oceans using Tableau. The dashboard provides interactive insights into plastic waste distribution by type, region, and depth, as well as its growth trends over time. The goal is to highlight patterns, identify high-risk areas, and raise awareness of the environmental impact.

## Dataset Used

File Name: https://github.com/chinnaobulareddy/Data-Analysis-Dashboard/blob/main/ocean_plastic_pollution_data.csv

The dataset contains plastic waste data (in kilograms) across different oceans from 2015 to 2025, categorized by:

Plastic Type (PE, PET, PP, PS, PVC)

Region (Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, Southern Oceans)

Depth (meters)


Data cleaning and preprocessing were performed before visualization to ensure accuracy.

## Key Questions (KPIs)

1. Total Plastic Waste (2015â€“2025): How much waste has accumulated over the years?


2. Plastic Waste by Type: Which types of plastic dominate ocean pollution?


3. Plastic Waste by Region: Which oceans are most affected?


4. Plastic Waste by Depth: How deep is plastic penetrating into ocean layers?


5. Trend Analysis: Is ocean plastic waste still increasing?


6. Waste Composition (%): What share does each plastic type contribute to the total?



## Tools & Technologies

Tableau Public â€“ Data Visualization

Excel / CSV â€“ Data Preparation & Cleaning

 ## How to Use

1. Download the dataset from this repository.


2. Open the Tableau workbook (.twbx file if you export it).


3. Explore interactive charts, filters, and KPIs.



## Insights

Plastic waste shows a rising trend from 2015 to 2025.

Polyethylene (PE) and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) are the largest contributors.

The Pacific and Atlantic Oceans are among the most impacted regions.

Pollution is not limited to the surface; it penetrates multiple depth levels.
